## Technical Implementation

### Gender Perception Parameters

**Formant Frequencies** (primary gender indicator):
- **Male voices**: Lower F1 (500-800 Hz), lower F2 (1000-1700 Hz)
- **Female voices**: Higher F1 (700-1000 Hz), higher F2 (1400-2300 Hz)
- **Control via**: `brightness` (high = female), `warmth` (high = male)

**Pitch/F0 Range** (secondary gender indicator):
- **Male bass**: 85-330 Hz
- **Female alto**: 175-590 Hz (octave higher than male bass)
- **Control via**: MIDI note input, `pitch_variation`

**Vibrato Characteristics**:
- **Male**: Slower (4-6 Hz), moderate depth (18-26%)
- **Female**: Faster (6-8 Hz), greater depth (28-38%)
- **Control via**: `vibrato_rate`, `vibrato_depth`

**Breathiness**:
- **Female classical**: Often more breathy (12-18%)
- **Male classical**: Less breathy (5-10%)
- **Control via**: `breathiness`

### Preset File Structure

```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "voice_types": {
      "soprano": 25,    // 25% of total voices
      "alto": 25,
      "tenor": 25,
      "bass": 25
    },
    "gender_balance": {
      "male": 50,       // 50% male voices
      "female": 50      // 50% female voices
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage in Ensemble

When loading a mixed ensemble preset:

1. **Voice Allocation**: VoiceManager allocates voices according to `voice_types` distribution
2. **Formant Selection**: Each voice gets formants appropriate to its voice type
3. **Gender Balance**: Overall mix respects `gender_balance` ratio
4. **Pitch Assignment**: MIDI notes distributed across vocal ranges

**Example: SATB Balanced Preset**
- Total voices: 16
- Voice types: 4 soprano (F), 4 alto (F), 4 tenor (M), 4 bass (M)
- Gender balance: 50% male, 50% female
- Result: 8 female voices (4F high + 4F low), 8 male voices (4M high + 4M low)

## Female Bass vs Male Bass: Detailed Comparison

### Acoustic Differences

| Characteristic | Female Alto (Low F) | Male Bass (Low M) | Difference |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **F1 Frequency** | 700-900 Hz | 500-700 Hz | +200 Hz |
| **F2 Frequency** | 1400-1800 Hz | 1000-1400 Hz | +400 Hz |
| **F3 Frequency** | 2500-2700 Hz | 2500-2700 Hz | Similar |
| **Pitch Range** | F3-D5 (175-590 Hz) | F2-E4 (85-330 Hz) | +1 octave |
| **Vocal Weight** | Light, present | Heavy, powerful | Opposite |
| **Timbre** | Clear, bright | Dark, warm | Opposite |

### Musical Context

**Female Alto (Low Female)**:
- Provides: Low harmony in female ensembles
- Blend: With soprano (SSAA), not with male bass
- Use: Female choirs, treble, folk, pop
- Range: Foundation for female harmony, not truly "bass"

**Male Bass (Low Male)**:
- Provides: True bass foundation, power, depth
- Blend: With tenor/baritone (SATB), not with female alto
- Use: Mixed choirs, orchestral, power, traditional
- Range: True bass foundation, lowest voice in SATB

### When to Use Each

**Use Female Alto when**:
- Building female ensembles (SSAA)
- Need clarity in low register (female perspective)
- Folk, pop, contemporary music with female leads
- Brighter, lighter low harmony desired

**Use Male Bass when**:
- Building mixed ensembles (SATB)
- Need true bass foundation and power
- Orchestral, traditional, classical music
- Darker, warmer low end required

**Never confuse**:
- Female alto is NOT a replacement for male bass
- They occupy different pitch ranges and timbral spaces
- Female alto sings in female alto range (F3-D5)
- Male bass sings in male bass range (F2-E4)
